# SAP MMâ€“PP Data Analytics: Warehouse and Production Optimization Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my expertise in **SAP MM (Materials Management) and SAP PP (Production Planning),** focusing on **Warehouse Management, Production Operations, Inventory Control, and Reporting.** By leveraging key SAP transaction codes as **MIGO, MIRO, MB52, MB51, MB5B, MM01, MBIC, COOISPI, and ZPP418, COR6N, COGI**, I streamlined warehouse processes, optimized production material flows, improved reconciliation and inventory accuracy, automated reporting  and enhanced overall supply chain efficiency.

## Scope of Work
The project covers the end-to-end process flow, including:
- **Goods Receipt (GR)** â€“ Receiving materials into stock.
- **Goods Issue (GI)** â€“ Issuing materials to production, cost centers, or sales.
- **Transfer Posting** â€“ Internal stock transfers within or across plants.
- **Invoice Verification** â€“ Matching supplier invoices against purchase orders and goods receipts.
- **Stock in Transit Management** â€“ Monitoring and reconciling in-transit stock.
- **Physical Inventory Adjustments** â€“ Managing stock counts, corrections, and posting differences.
- **Production Order Management** â€“ Tracking, confirming, and correcting production-related material movements.
